V1-V6 (mainly v6.1-6.3 had 30~ in each of 5 conditions) are designs mainly for tests with 2 responses at the final test. RT are recoded as one for both responses.

v10 only had 1 response at the final test, and the RT is better recorded, rt of first key press is recorded, 50~+25 in each condition, the second set of 25 is "correct version" because first 50 had issues in final test with feedbacks.
