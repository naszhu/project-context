            If you agree to be in the study, you will do the following things. First, the experiment will ask for you to input your ID in Prolific.  
            The study will take place in the web and the time to complete it will vary among different participants and different experiments length, but it will take 45-50 mins in average. First, you will be shown a list of words to remember. Then you will be given additional instructions telling you the way your memory will be tested. Then you will be shown a long series of pictures to remember, followed by tests of your memory. The memory tests are simple and are of two types. Sometimes you will be shown a word’s first letter, and you will try to type the word beginning with that letter, if you can remember it, or press the space bar if you cannot. Other times you will be shown a word or a picture and decide whether it was one you studied. About half the time it will have been one you studied and about half the time a new word or picture. Before agreeing to participate, please consider the risks and potential benefits of taking part in this study. While participating in the study, the only potential risk is loss of confidentiality.  </h1> <br> 
             
             <h1 style='color: black;text-align: left;background: white;font: caption;'> To protect against loss of confidentiality, any identifiable information from the data that could lead back to you will be removed within two days of your completion of the study.We don’t think you will have any personal benefits from taking part in this study, but we hope to learn things that will help researchers in the future.
